== Civic Pheromones == 
Easy info sharing about community projects.

+ Jose has an account on ioby.org, but his local rooftop farm decides to launch their campaign on Change By Us...
+ Frank finds out about public meetings on bike lanes from  BikeBlog, but the editors don’t know about the Flatbush meeting tomorrow, so he misses it...
+ Emma follows a list of environmental groups, but the maintainer of the list goes to grad school...
+ City Groups launches in Boston, but so does Yelp Community Edition...

Civic Pheromones are simple data feeds from civic websites. Pheromones transmit various useful information:
+ where a project is based (geography)
+ what’s going on (meetings, events)
+ what the project does (topics, activities)
+ where to find out more (blog, twitter, contact details)

There’s no “there” there for Pheremones. No new website to follow. Civic Pheromones are invisible. They’re all about transmission of useful information from existing sources. 

== Let’s get smelly! ==

To make pheromones useful, we need some publishers, and some aggregators. For example:
myCommunityProject.org is a community-building website for neighborhood projects




== Background reading ==
+ Ether, a transparent medium that supports the transfer of essential information about community-led projects. http://opensourceplanning.org/2011/06/ether/
